Here is the full text translation, maintaining the technical terminology as is.

### Konnect `teams` and `roles`

**Uses: Konnect Platform**

To help secure and govern your environment, Konnect provides the ability to manage `authorization` using `teams` and `roles`. You can use Konnect’s predefined teams for a standard set of roles, or create `custom teams` with any roles you choose. Invite users and add them to these teams to manage user access.

You must either be a member of the `Organization Admin` team, or be assigned the `Identity Admin` role, to manage users, teams, and roles.

> **Note:** If the `Okta` integration is enabled, Konnect users and teams become `read-only`. An organization admin can view all registered users in Konnect, but cannot edit their team membership from the Konnect side. To manage automatically-created users, adjust user permissions through `Okta`, or adjust `team mapping`.

-----

### Access precedence

Users can be part of any number of teams, and the roles gained from the teams are `additive`. For example, if you add a user to both the `Service Developer` and `Portal Viewer` teams, the user can create and manage `Services` through `API Products` and register applications through the `Dev Portal`.

If two roles provide access to the same `entity`, the role with more access takes effect. For example, if you have the `Service Admin` role and the `Service Deployer` role on the same `Service`, the `Service Admin` role (the stronger one) takes precedence.

-----

### Geographic region assignment

`Teams` and `roles` can be assigned to a specific `geographic region` in Konnect. Those teams and roles only access Konnect objects (such as `Services`) that are also located in the same geo they are assigned to.

-----

### Teams

A `team` is a group of users with access to the same roles. Teams are useful for assigning access by functionality, where they can provide `granular access` to any group of Konnect resources based on roles.

You can create and manage teams by navigating to `Organization > Teams` in Konnect.

#### Predefined teams

All new and existing organizations in Konnect have predefined default teams. The default teams can’t be modified or deleted.

| Team | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`Analytics Admin`** | Users can fully manage all `Analytics` content, which includes creating, editing, and deleting reports, as well as viewing the analytics summary. |
| **`Analytics Viewer`** | Users can view the `Analytics` summary and report data. |
| **`Organization Admin`** | Users can fully manage all entities and configuration in the organization. In addition to users granted the `Organization Admin` role, each organization also has one `Owner`, who always has this role and is the only user who can delete the organization. |
| **`Organization Admin (Read Only)`** | Users can view all entities and configuration in the organization (read-only). |
| **`Portal Admin`** | Users can fully manage all `Dev Portal` content, which includes Konnect service pages and supporting content, as well as `Dev Portal` configuration and Service connections. To manage app registration requests, members must also be assigned to the `Admin` or `Maintainer` roles for the corresponding Services. |
| **`API Product Admin`** | Users can create and manage `API products`, including publishing `API product` versions to `Dev Portal` and enabling application registration. |
| **`API Product Developer`** | Users can create and manage `versions` of `API products`. |
| **`Control Plane Admin`** | Users can create and manage `Control Planes`. |

#### Create a custom team

`Custom teams` let organizations manage user access by grouping roles and permissions. Any user added to a custom team automatically inherits all roles assigned to that team.

To create and configure a custom team:

1.  **Create the team**
    Send a `POST` request to the `/teams` `endpoint` with the name and description in the `request body`. Save the `team_id` from the response.
2.  **Assign roles to the team**
    Send a `POST` request to the `/assigned-roles` `endpoint` to grant the team specific roles.
3.  **Add users to the team**
    To give a user access to the team’s roles, you must assign them to the team. Send a `POST` request to the `/users` `endpoint`. Users can belong to multiple teams and inherit roles from each.
4.  **(Optional) Enable group-to-team mappings**
    If `SSO (Single Sign-On)` is enabled, you can configure Konnect to automatically map users to teams based on `group claims` from your `IdP`. To do this, send a `PUT` request to the `/team-mappings` `endpoint` with `team_ids` in the request body.

-----

### Roles

`Roles` predefine access to a particular resource, or `instances` of a particular resource type (for example, `API product` roles can be `scoped` to a particular `API product` or all `API products` while `Control Plane` roles can be `scoped` to a particular `Control Plane` or all `Control Planes`).

You can manage a user’s roles by navigating to `Organization > Users` in Konnect and clicking the `Role Assignments` tab for a user.
